## Abstract

This research investigates how perceived economic scarcity is associated with heightened sensitivity to economic inequality-related cues. Across three preregistered studies, participants completed a speeded-decision (N = 580 and N = 206) and a change-blindness task (N = 210). We hypothesized that perceived economic scarcity would be associated with heightened attention to inequality-related cues. Results from Study 1 and 2 provided partial support of increased attention to information related to how resources are distributed. However, results from Study 3, using a more ecologically valid paradigm, are not consistent with our hypothesis. A multiverse analysis revealed that core findings were robust across specifications. These results offer a potential cognitive explanation of how economic inequality can act as a catalyst for individuals experiencing scarcity, through increased attentional tuning to economically salient features in the environment
