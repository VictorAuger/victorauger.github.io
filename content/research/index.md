**1. Poverty in Economically Unequal Context: Psychological Consequences**

My research explores how the experience of poverty interacts with economic inequality to shape psychological outcomes. I investigate how the lack of financial resources affects cognitive processes, such as decision-making and attention, and how these effects are amplified or mitigated in contexts with varying levels of income inequality.

**2. Mental Visual Representation of Social Class**

I study how individuals mentally represent social class and how these perceptions are influenced by economic and social factors. Using reverse correlation methods, I examine the intersection of social class and gender to uncover biases in mental imagery. Additionally, I investigate how economic inequality shapes visual representations of social class, providing insights into the ways inequality affects perception and stereotyping.

**3. Research Practices**

In parallel, I am also interested in the developments of new research practices in psychological science. Specifically, I explore the use of simulations at various stages of the research process and advocate for reflection the criteria used for assessing scientific contributions.
